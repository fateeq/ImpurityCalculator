        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The USP Ractopamine Impurities Calculator was created by me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/farahateeq/" target="_blank">Farah</a>, a former chemist delving into the tech world. The calculator is a beginner JavaScript application created for the purposes of my <a href="https://fateeq.github.io" target="_blank">portfolio</a>.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for the calculator came from a problem I faced often at work when I was a chemist. The application is essentially a clean-looking, error-free alternative to the spreadsheet calculations my colleagues had to perform and that I had to review.</p>
        <p>While I drew inspiration from problems at work, this application was created solely for my practice.</p>
        <p>Tools used to build the calculator: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript<br>
           You can view the code <a href="https://github.com/fateeq/impurityCalculator" target="_blank">here</a>.
